[Loon Beginner Config](https://www.nsloon.com/openloon/import?sub=https://kelee.one/Tool/Loon/Lcf/en-US/Loon_Beginner_Config_By_iKeLee.lcf) - This configuration file is ideal for beginners, as it contains only one policy group, allowing newcomers to get started more quickly.

[Loon Auto Select Config](https://www.nsloon.com/openloon/import?sub=https://kelee.one/Tool/Loon/Lcf/en-US/Loon_Auto_Select_Config_By_iKeLee.lcf) - This configuration file automatically selects the node with the lowest network latency without any manual intervention; the entire process is fully automated.

[Loon Manual Select Config](https://www.nsloon.com/openloon/import?sub=https://kelee.one/Tool/Loon/Lcf/en-US/Loon_Manual_Select_Config_By_iKeLee.lcf) - This configuration file requires you to manually select the desired proxy server. In the event of a failure, it will not automatically switch servers, so you must intervene to choose an available alternative.

[Loon Advanced Config](https://www.nsloon.com/openloon/import?sub=https://kelee.one/Tool/Loon/Lcf/en-US/Loon_Advanced_Config_By_iKeLee.lcf) - This configuration file automatically selects the proxy node with the lowest network latency, requiring no manual intervention—all processes are fully automated. When connected to a router equipped with a transparent proxy, Loon will use the "Direct" strategy to establish connections and route traffic for websites requiring proxying directly through your router; in other network environments, Loon will use its own proxy mode to access these websites, thereby avoiding double proxying when already using a transparent proxy router.

[Loon Debug Config](https://www.nsloon.com/openloon/import?sub=https://kelee.one/Tool/Loon/Lcf/en-US/Loon_Debug_Config_By_iKeLee.lcf) - This configuration file can be used to verify Loon's program errors and also serves as a foundation for creating your own custom configuration.

[tvOS config](https://www.nsloon.com/openloon/import?sub=https://kelee.one/Tool/Loon/Lcf/en-US/Loon_tvOS_Config_By_iKeLee.lcf) - This Config file is specifically designed for tvOS. Some policy groups will automatically select the proxy server with the lowest network latency, while others require you to manually choose a server.
